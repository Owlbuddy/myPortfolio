look and feel-
    could use constant NAV bar up top, since NAV shuffles, difficult to you


functionality-
    works great!
    I attempted to trade out the background gif for some JS, to make it more dynamic and code driven (to add JS)

no known bugs
some redundacy in nav
readability could use some work

security?

browser compatibility?

I love the site!
